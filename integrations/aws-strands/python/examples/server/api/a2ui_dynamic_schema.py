## Available Pre-made Components

You have 3 card components. Use Row as the root with structural children to
repeat a card per item.

### Row
Layout container. Repeat a card template via structural children:
  {"id":"root","component":"Row","children":{"componentId":"card","path":"/items"}}

### HotelCard
Props: name, location, rating (number 0-5), pricePerNight, action

### ProductCard
Props: name, price, rating (number 0-5), description (optional), action

### TeamMemberCard
Props: name, role, department (optional), email (optional), action

## RULES
- Root is ALWAYS a Row with structural children: {"componentId":"<card-id>","path":"/items"}
- ALWAYS include the referenced card component in the components array.
- Inside templates use RELATIVE paths (no leading slash): {"path":"name"}.
- Always provide data in the "data" argument as {"items":[...]}.
- Pick the card type that best matches the request; generate 3-4 realistic items.

When the user asks for visual content (product comparisons, dashboards, team

The tool renders UI automatically. Just confirm what was rendered."""
