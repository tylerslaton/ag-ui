A plain agent with no a2ui wiring. The adapter auto-injects ``generate_a2ui``,

## Available Pre-made Components

Use Row as the root with structural children to repeat a card per item.

### Row
Repeat a card template via structural children:
  {"id":"root","component":"Row","children":{"componentId":"card","path":"/items"}}

### HotelCard / ProductCard / TeamMemberCard
Card components bound to per-item data (relative paths inside the template).

## RULES
- Root is ALWAYS a Row with structural children: {"componentId":"<card-id>","path":"/items"}
- ALWAYS include the referenced card component in the components array.
- Inside templates use RELATIVE paths (no leading slash): {"path":"name"}.
- Always provide data in the "data" argument as {"items":[...]}.
- Generate 3-4 realistic items with diverse data.
